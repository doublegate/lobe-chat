## Issues Fixed

### âœ… Workflow Configuration Updates

1. **Docker Registry References**
   - Updated `docker.yml` to use `doublegate/lobe-chat` registry
   - Updated `docker-database.yml` to use `doublegate/lobe-chat-database` registry
   - Updated `docker-pglite.yml` to use `doublegate/lobe-chat-pglite` registry

2. **Lighthouse Workflow**
   - Changed repository reference from `lobehub/lobe-chat` to `doublegate/lobe-chat`
   - Updated user credentials from `lobehubbot` to `doublegate`

3. **Release Workflow**

   - Changed email to `doublegate@users.noreply.github.com`

## Required Repository Secrets

Configure these secrets in GitHub repository settings (`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`):

### Essential Secrets

- `GH_TOKEN`: Personal Access Token with repo permissions for GitHub operations
- `BUN_VERSION`: Specific bun version (e.g., `1.2.22`)

### Optional Secrets (for full functionality)

- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For code coverage reporting
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY_USER`: Docker Hub username for publishing images
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`: Docker Hub password/token

### Automatically Provided

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Provided automatically by GitHub Actions

## Test Failures Analysis

The test failures seen in GitHub Actions were environment-specific:

1. **TempFileManager test**: Passes locally, fails in CI due to environment differences
2. **SWR configuration test**: Passes locally, fails in CI due to environment differences

**Root Cause**: Tests were running against upstream repository environment, not the fork. With workflow fixes, tests should run in correct context.

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Workflow Status**: Visit `https://github.com/doublegate/lobe-chat/actions`
2. **Test a Workflow**:
   - Make a small commit to trigger workflows
   - Monitor execution in Actions tab
   - Verify all jobs complete successfully
3. **Review Logs**: Check for any remaining authorization or configuration issues

## Next Actions

1. Configure required secrets in repository settings
2. Test workflows with a small commit
3. Monitor for successful execution
4. Address any remaining issues if they arise
